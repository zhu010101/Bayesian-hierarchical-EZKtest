# EZK-Diagnostic-Test-Analysis

## Author

## Introduction
In response to concerns about a new influenza strain (K9C9), researchers developed the EZK diagnostic test, which is inexpensive but prone to false positives and negatives. The World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored a clinical trial across 10 countries, testing 100 subjects per country with both a highly accurate test and the EZK test.
This analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic ability of the EZK test using a **Bayesian hierarchical model** that accounts for country-specific variations. By assessing the probability of infection based on EZK results, we provide insights into the test's effectiveness and inform cost-effective healthcare decisions.
